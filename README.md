# RUL Prediction Using SVR
This repository demonstrates the work done by me and my team for our project which was to implement "Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Cutting Tools using Support Vector Regression" (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/576/1/012021/pdf). Source code can be found in the ML_Project.ipnb file which is shared from google colab (where my team collaborated)

The datset we were provided was from **IEEE PHM 2012 Prognostic challenge**
